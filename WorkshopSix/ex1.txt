As discussed in the lessons, write a program containing a function called word_frequency that counts and how often each unique word in a file occurs. Your program should use a dictionary, deal with text files that have more than one word per line (use split), and read and process one line at a time, rather than reading the entire file in one go.

You should also remove punctuation from each line. This can most easily be done using a list of the punctuation characters and the replace(s, t) method on string, which replaces occurrences of s with t. Thus:


>>> punctuation = ’!"#$%&´()*+,-./:;<=>?@[\]^_‘|~’
>>> line = ’this is a $%^& string with too much <=^ punctuation!’
>>> for s in string.punctuation:
... line = line.replace(s, ’ ’)
...
>>> line
’this is a string with too much punctuation’

There are more efficient ways of removing the punctuation, but this is straightforward and clear. Test the function on ex1.txt.
